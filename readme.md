# Kykloforia

Python utilities to support and extend FAA SWIM data processing workflows.  
This project is designed to work in tandem with the FAA's Consumer Jumpstart Kit (Track/FP Data), enabling safe backup and structured extraction of flight data from `.log` files generated during message consumption.

---

## Project Structure

This project includes the following tools:

### `log_backup.py`  

Backup utility to safeguard `.log` files generated by the FAAâ€™s jumpstart-latest SWIM JMS data downloader. Since logs are produced live and may rotate unpredictably, this script monitors the log directory and archives completed files to prevent accidental loss.

Key features:
- Preserves `.log`, `.log1`, `.log2`, etc.
- Moves them to a timestamped archive directory
- Ensures logs are complete and accessible for post-processing

---

### `parce9.py`  

This script parses FAA `.log` files into a standardized text format compatible with OpenARIA's CSV format.

Key functionality:
- Extracts 9 fields per message including time, latitude, longitude, altitude, aircraft ID, type, and callsign
- Skips records missing required information
- Produces two output files:
  - `parsed_output.txt`: Clean, complete entries
  - `bad_data.txt`: Summary and listing of skipped rows (for transparency and review)

---

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Set up and run the FAA Consumer Jumpstart Kit**  
   Extract and configure the Java client downloaded from the FAA SWIM portal, and launch using `bin\run.bat` with the correct parameters:
2. **Run `log_backup.py`**  
While the consumer is running, use this script to back up `.log` files in real time.

3. **Run `parce9.py`**  
After backups are created, use this parser to convert `.log` data into structured output suitable for ingestion or analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- FAA Jumpstart Kit for Track/FP Data (downloaded from the FAA SWIM portal)
- Java 11+ to run the FAA consumer

---

## Notes

- These tools do not replace the FAA consumer, but enhance post-processing and safety of the log data.
- FAA SWIM data is for research and development use only and not for operational use.
- Be aware that field structures and message formats may change. Adjustments to parsing logic may be required over time.
